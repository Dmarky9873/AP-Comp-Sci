3 Error Types:

    1. Syntax/Compiler Error

        Examples:

        System.ot.print("Hi");
        problem: out is spelled wrong

        system.out.print("Hi");
        problem: the S in System should be capitalized

        Detection:
        While some IDEs will detect syntax errors as code is typed, syntax errors are identified when the program is compiled. A program will not compile or run while syntax errors are present.

    2. Exception

        Example:
        The program attempts to divide a number by 0.

        Detection: 
        Exceptions occur while the program is running and will cause the program to terminate abnormally. A program "throws an exception".

    3. Logic Error

        Example:
        The programmer accidentally uses a minus (-) instead of a plus (+) when finding the sum of two numbers.

        Detection: 
        Logic errors are usually detected after a program has been run when actual output is compared to anticipated output.sw
