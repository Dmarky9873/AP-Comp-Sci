The three primitive data types used in the course are `int`, `double`, and `Boolean`. 

Each variable has associated memory that is used to hold its value.

The memory associated with a variable of a primitive type holds an actual primitive value.

When a variable is declared `final`, its value cannot be chanced once it is initialized.

What is a variable?
    A variable is a name given to a memory location that is holding a specified type of value.

Naming a variable
    Rules:
        May consist of letters, digits or an underscore (case sensitive)
        May not start with a digits
        Spaces are not allowed
        May not use any other characters such as &, @ or $
        May not use Java reserved words

    As a good practice, variable names should start with a lowercase letter and use "camel case": "thisIsAGoodExample"

Declaring variables in code:
    Primitive data types:
        Integers: int
        Floating-point values: double
        Boolean values: boolean
    Uses the format: (data type) (variable name);

    If you want to declare a variable that cannot be changed once given a value you use the `final` reserved word.
        Example:
            final double DAYS_IN_WEEK;

        ***For final variables (constants), use ALL CAPS and underscores when naming.
