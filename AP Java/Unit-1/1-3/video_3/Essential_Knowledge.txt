The assignment operator (=) allows a program to initialize or change the value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is stored in the variable on the left. (int x = 5;)

    The equals sign (=) is a instruction. It assigns the value on the right of the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR to the variable on the left.

    You can have multiple on the same line, it works right to left.

    x = y = z = 7; 

    All of the above are equal to 7.

During execution, expressions are evaluated to produce a single value.

    The order of operations still applies, and the assignment operator comes after everything is evaluated (after BEDMAS).

The value of an expression has a type based on the evaluation of the expression.
