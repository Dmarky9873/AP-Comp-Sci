A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a superclass.

Classes that extend a superclass, called subclasses, can draw upon the existing attributes and behaviors of the superclass without repeating these in code.

Extending a subclass from a superclass creates an "is-a" relationship from the subclass to the superclass.

What is inheritance?
    Parent classes (superclasses) have attributes and behaviors that can be inherited by child classes (subclasses).

Why do we use inheritance?
    Code reusability
        Higher level classes can be used over and over again in many situations.

    Prevents repeating code
        Common methods and variables are now in one location, rather than in many.

    Readability and organization
        Having a solid, organized structure of your classes and objects allows for greater readability and cohesion.

    Ease of maintenance
        Changing a general behavior in one place rather than many saves time and effort.
