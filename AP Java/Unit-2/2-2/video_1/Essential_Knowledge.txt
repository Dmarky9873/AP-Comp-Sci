A signature consists of fthe constructor name and the parameter list.

The parameter list, in the header of a constructor, lists the types of values that are passed and their variable names. These are often referred to as formal paramters.

A parameter is a value that is passed into a constructor. These are often referred to as actual paramters.

Constructors are said to be overloaded when there are multiple constructors with the same name but a different signature.

The actual paramters passed to a constructor must be compatible with the types identified in the formal paramter list.

Parameters are passed using call by value. Call by value initializes the formal parameters with copies of the actual parameters.
