The casting* operators (int) (double) can be used to create a temporary value converted to a different data type.

    *Casting: to change the data type of a variable from one type to another.

Casting a double value to an int causes the digits to the right of the decimal point to be truncated**.

    **Truncated: shortened.

Some programming code causes int values to be automatically cast (widened) to double values.

Values of type double can be rounded to the nearest integer by:

    Positive numbers:
        (int)(x + 0.5)

    Negative numbers:
        (int)(x - 0.5)
