A literal ("hello there") is the literal code representation of a fixed value.

Arithmetic expressions include expressons of type `int` and `double`.

The arithmetic operators consist of +,-,*,/,%

An arithmetic operation that uses two `int` values will evaluate to an int value.

An arithmetic operation that uses a `double` value will evaluate to a double value.

Aritmetic operators:
    Addition (+): Gives the sum of a addition problem.
    Subtraction (-): Gives the difference of a subtraction problem
    Multiplication (*): Gives the product of a multiplication problem.
    Divsion (/): Gives quotient of a division problem (rounds down for ints e.g. 1/2 = 0)
    Modulus (%): Gives remainder of a division problem

    ***For any situation involving a int and a double the result will be a double (the bigger data type)
