Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method signature as a public method in the superclass.

Any method that is called must be defined within its own class or its superclass.

A subclass is usually designed to have modified (overridden) or additional methods or instance variables.

A subclass will inherit all public methods from the superclass; these methods remain public in the subclass.
